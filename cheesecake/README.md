Ingredients
-----------

* 2½ lb of unsalted, creamy white cheese
* ¾ lb of sour cream (18%)
* 5 big eggs (¾ lb in total)
* ¼ pound of unsalted butter
* 1 cup of cane sugar (½ pound)
* 1 tbsp. vanilla sugar (or some vanilla extract)
* 1 pack of vanilla pudding powder (2 oz)
* 1 pack of biscuits

Topping ingredients
-------------------

* 2 ounces of milk chocolate
* 4 ounces of dark chocolate
* 4 ounces of whipping cream
* shredded coconut

Procedure
---------

1. Remove ingredients from the fridge so that they soften a bit.
1. Preheat the oven to 300 F (without fan assistance!).
1. Butter the bottom of the baking form and put one layer of biscuits on it.
1. Carefully separate egg whites from yolks.
1. Beat yolks with sugar and vanilla sugar, add butter.
1. Add pudding powder, cheese and sour cream. Mix/beat well (don’t beat too
   long, though, or the cake won’t be fluffy).
1. Whip egg whites (it’s best to whip them in a metal bowl), add it to the
   cheese and mix gently with a big spoon until the foam blends with the cheese
   completely. Pour into baking form.
1. Bake for 60-75 minutes.
1. Don’t cool too rapidly.

When the cake has mostly cooled down, you can prepare the chocolate topping in
a double boil:

1. Boil some water in a pot, put a bowl on top of that (so that the steam heats
   the bowl).
1. Put cream in the bowl and wait until it gets hot.
1. Add cracked chocolate and mix until it melts (preferably with a whisk).
1. Pour over the cake.
1. When the chocolate starts to set, sprinkle it with shredded coconut.

Cool in the refridgerator overnight.
